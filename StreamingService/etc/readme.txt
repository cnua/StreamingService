Basemap Technical Exercise

This exercise should take between 1 and 2 hours

The repository contains a VS solution (StreamingService.sln) containing 2 projects

StreamingService
StreamingService.Test
StreamingService.Services.UserService is quite badly desgined/written. 
You'll notice the other classes in the project are not full implemented; 
they exist only so that you will be able to build and eventually unit test the UserService.

Tasks:
Review and re-write UserService, applying SOLID principles to the class(es)

Write unit tests to provide code coverage for the improved UserService class(es) to 
demonstrate the improve code works, even though the repositories are unimplemented.

There isn’t a perfect or correct answer, and do not worry if you cannot get all the tests working. 
This exercise is designed to gauge your level of understanding and I am looking to see your approach.

Zip your solution and email it to lphillips@basemap.co.uk, for fork this repo and share a link.

If you feel it helpful, feel free to explain your reasoning in comments. You will not mark you down for over commenting on this exercise.

SOLID becomes a methodology toolkit extracted from the principles
for each principle min solid
review the code an d refactor accordingly
